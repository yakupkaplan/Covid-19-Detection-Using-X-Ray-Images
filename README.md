# Covid-19-Detection-Using-X-Ray-Images

In this notebook we try to detect COVID-19 by using x-ray images.

__Datasets to be used:__

   - Covid Chest X Ray Dataset -> used for covid-19 positive images
   - Pneumonia dataset by Praveen -> pneumonia negative images used for covid-19 negative images

-> By using these datasets 500 Covid-19 positive images and 1600 Covid-19 negative images are created.
